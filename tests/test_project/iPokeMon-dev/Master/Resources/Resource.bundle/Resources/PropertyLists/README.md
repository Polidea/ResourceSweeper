The files in _"Resources/Pokemon_tmp_files"_ are not needed for the final binary. These are for populating CoreData's persistent store db: _"Resources/db/sqlit.Pokemon.sqlite3"_. The files are shared at [iPokeMon-Doc][1].

Just copy all files into _"Resources/Pokemon_tmp_files"_.

Thanks @alexrezit for your feedback.
